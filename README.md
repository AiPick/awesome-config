# Red Flat Awesome WM config
Custom config for [Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org). All stuff like self-written widgets, utilities and modification parts of another's configs are collected in one module called `redflat`.

Warning: this config was designed for awesome wm v3.5.6 and abandoned now. Check `master` branch for actual config version.
